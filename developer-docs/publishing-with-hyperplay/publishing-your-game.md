**IMPORTANT:** We recommend developers have a playable build before applying to list their game to expedite the process. Our developer docs are user-friendly and will guide you through each step of the publishing process. Once we meet with you, we'll provide you with a link to our developer portal.

After completing all the necessary steps, our security team will review your submitted build to ensure there is no malicious content and that the game is safe for our players. The review process typically takes up to five business days. Upon completion, we will publish your game on the HyperPlay store for players to download and enjoy.
