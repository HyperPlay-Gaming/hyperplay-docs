# Publishing With HyperPlay

This guide is designed to provide you with all the information you need to list your game with HyperPlay, a web3-native game launcher. HyperPlay addresses the wallet interaction problem faced by developers by enabling players to bring their wallet, NFTs, tokens, and achievements into every game. With simple APIs, developers can request transactions, signatures, or any web3 request, regardless of the player's chosen wallet. HyperPlay also solves the wallet user experience problem and makes interoperability the default. Additionally, it acts as an aggregator of game stores, including Epic, GOG, the HyperPlay store, and many more to come.
