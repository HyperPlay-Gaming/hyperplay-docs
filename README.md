## Welcome to HyperPlay

HyperPlay is a web3-native game launcher that enables players to carry their wallet, NFTs, tokens, and achievements into every game. HyperPlay makes in-game wallet interactions seamless and intuitive.&#x20;

HyperPlay aims to reverse the de-platforming of developers and the monopolistic fees of web2. We provide a web3-native game store and aggregate the Epic Store and GOG, providing developers with maximal freedom to choose the store that works best for them.

## Installing HyperPlay

HyperPlay is available as a native desktop application for Windows, SteamDeck, Linux, and MacOS.\
The early access alpha client is now publicly available for download on [hyperplay.xyz](https://hyperplay.xyz).&#x20;
