# ðŸŽ± API for Native Games (Non-EVM)

## Overview

HyperPlay is a web3-native game launcher with wallet integration. The launcher acts as a proxy between the desktop game and wallet. Any game on HyperPlay can trigger a wallet interaction with a simple HTTP request.

* Game triggers a HTTP request
* HyperPlay launcher receives the request and forwards it to the player's wallet
* If the player connected via MetaMask Mobile or WalletConnect, there will be a mobile popup
* If the player connected via MetaMask Extension, there will be an in game overlay
* The player can decide to approve or reject the transaction
