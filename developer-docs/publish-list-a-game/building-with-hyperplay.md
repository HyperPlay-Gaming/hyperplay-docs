# ⚒️ Building with HyperPlay

**Install HyperPlay**

The first step to testing your game with HyperPlay is to install the HyperPlay app.&#x20;

**Test Your Game**

In order to test your game from within HyperPlay, you can start by side-loading your game into HyperPlay locally to test its performance. To side-load your game in the HyperPlay client, follow these steps:

1. Launch the HyperPlay client and navigate to the "Library" section.
2. Click on the "Add Game" button located at the top of the client window.
3. Fill out the relevant information, such as the game title, in the "Add Game" window.
4. Click on the folder icon under "Select Executable" and locate the .EXE file you wish to import.
5. If your game uses our wallet APIs, select the checkbox "This game was web3 features."
6. Click on "Finish" to begin the import process.
7. Once the game has been imported, it will appear in your library, and you can launch it by clicking on the "Play" button.

For developers looking to test amongst a larger group, it is also possible to create an access code-gated branch in the HyperPlay developer portal. For more information on this, review the [Developer Portal](developer-portal.md) documentation.
