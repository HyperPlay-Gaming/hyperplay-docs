# Benefits of using a Compatibility Layer

Using compatibility layers in software like HyperPlay is essential for several reasons:

1. **Expanding Game Support Across Platforms** Most PC games are developed primarily for Windows. The Compatibility layers implementation on HyperPlay allow these games to run on Linux and macOS without requiring native ports. This significantly decreases the development time focusing on a single platform.
2. **Bridging the Gap Without Developer Intervention** Many game developers do not prioritize Linux or macOS support due to market share concerns. Compatibility layers provide an alternative, letting users play their favorite games without waiting for official ports or developer support.
3. **Avoiding Vendor Lock-in** By supporting multiple platforms through compatibility layers, users are not forced to stay on Windows just for gaming. This promotes an OS-agnostic gaming ecosystem, allowing users to choose their preferred operating system.
4. **Enabling a Unified Gaming Experience** Applications like HyperPlay aggregate multiple game stores (HyperPlay, Epic, GOG) under one platform. By incorporating compatibility layers, users can access their entire game library without worrying about OS restrictions.
